      "pTwo": "You could choose dishes from an online database and the app would help you through the entire process. You'd start with buying the ingredients and end with your prepared meal.",
      "pThree": "To choose a dish, you could speak to your watch and after that, with the help of the Watson API, we determined what it was you wanted to prepare and for how many people.",
      "pFour": "The name ABC-Cooking is an acronym for Appetite, Buy, Cook. When you decide you have an appetite, you choose a dish. The app would then lead you to the buy stage and eventually help you cook your meal."
